# SOCIAL MEDIA FOR DEVELOPERS

A personal project to practice full-stack Web development using **NextJS** for the frontend and **ASP. NET Core** for the backend.

## Project Description

A social platform where developers can `post`, `comment`, `add/copy code snippets`, `attach tags` of certain topics, ... to _share their experience_ in the field, _ask for developing problems_, or simply _share memes_.
